# Decision trees

## Tree advantages over networks
- To train a network, a huge amount of input data and resource is required.
- You also can't see the network's decision structure - the black-box dilemma.
- Trees require less input, resource and their decision structure is transparent.
- Trees are much easier to explain visually.

## Class trees vs regression trees
- Both trees take numeric and categorical inputs.
- Class trees predict categorical outputs.
- Regression trees predict numeric outputs.


## Tree structure
- Keep the tree as small as possible.
