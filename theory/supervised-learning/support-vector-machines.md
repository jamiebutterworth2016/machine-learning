## Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Classification technique.
- Similar to logistic regression - both techniques use a line to separate the points but positions the line differently.
- Logistic regression **minimises** the distance between all points and the line.
- SVM **maximises** the distance (margin) between all points and the line.
