# Supervised learning
Supports both numeric predictions and classification.\
Classification appears to be the most useful.

Both inputs and output are known.

1. I take the output.
2. I take the inputs which created the output.
3. I discover the relationship between the inputs and the output.
4. I use this relationship to predict the output of future inputs.
